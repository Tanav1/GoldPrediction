# Gold Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the future price of gold using machine learning models.

## Introduction

In this project, we use historical gold price data to train machine learning models and make predictions about future gold prices. We'll explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train two different models (Decision Tree Regressor and Linear Regression), and evaluate their performance.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We begin by loading the dataset and calculating some statistics about the gold prices. These statistics include minimum price, maximum price, mean price, median price, and the standard deviation of prices.

## Data Preparation

We prepare the data for training by creating features (input variables) and a target variable (the predicted price). We also split the data into training and testing sets.

## Models

We train two different models:
1. Decision Tree Regressor
2. Linear Regression

## Prediction

We use the trained models to make predictions about future gold prices. The predictions are visualized alongside the actual prices.

## Conclusion
